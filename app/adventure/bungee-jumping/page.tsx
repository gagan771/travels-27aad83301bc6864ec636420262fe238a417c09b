          Jump from a height of 83 meters (272 feet) over a natural creek surrounded by lush forest. As you take the
          leap, experience a few seconds of breathtaking free fall before the bungee cord stretches and bounces you back
          up. The jump provides panoramic views of the surrounding hills and valleys, adding to the incredible
          experience.

        </p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
          Upon arrival, you'll be weighed to determine the appropriate bungee cord. After signing necessary waivers,
          you'll receive a safety briefing and be fitted with ankle harnesses. Then you'll walk onto the cantilever

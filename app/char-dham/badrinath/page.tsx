          Badrinath, situated at an elevation of 3,133 meters (10,279 feet) in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, is
          one of the most sacred Hindu pilgrimage sites in India. As the northernmost shrine of the Char Dham circuit,
          Badrinath is dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his Badrinath form and holds immense spiritual significance for
          Hindus.

        <h2>The Sacred Temple</h2>
        <p>
          The Badrinath Temple, believed to have been established by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century CE, features
          a striking facade with a small cupola of gilt gold. The temple houses a 1-meter tall black stone statue of
          Lord Badri (Vishnu) in a meditative pose under a Badri tree (Indian jujube). The architecture showcases
          elements of both North and South Indian temple styles, reflecting its pan-Indian importance.
        </p>

        <h2>Tapt Kund</h2>
        <p>
          Near the temple is Tapt Kund, a natural hot spring with medicinal properties. Pilgrims traditionally bathe in
          these sacred waters before entering the temple, as it is believed to cleanse the body of impurities. The
          spring maintains a pleasant temperature even during the freezing winter months, making it a unique geological
          feature of the area.
        </p>

        <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
        <p>
          According to Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu meditated here for thousands of years under a Badri tree, and when
          Goddess Lakshmi provided him shade from the weather as a Badri tree, the place became known as Badrinath. It
          is considered one of the most holy places to attain moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death).
        </p>

        <p>
          Like other Char Dham sites, Badrinath is accessible only during summer months (late April to early November)
          and closes during winter due to heavy snowfall. During this period, the deity is ceremoniously moved to
          Joshimath, where worship continues until the temple reopens.

          Gangotri, situated at an altitude of 3,100 meters (10,170 feet) in the Greater Himalayan Range, is one of the
          most sacred places in Hindu mythology. It marks the spiritual source of the Ganges River, India's holiest
          river, and is the second shrine in the Char Dham pilgrimage circuit.
        </p>

        <h2>The Sacred Temple</h2>
        <p>
          The Gangotri Temple, built in the 18th century by the Gorkha General Amar Singh Thapa, stands near the spot
          where according to legend, King Bhagirath performed penance to bring the Ganges to Earth. Constructed of white
          granite, this 20-foot-high temple features intricate carvings and houses a natural rock Shivalinga. The river
          in this area is called Bhagirathi, taking the name Ganga (Ganges) only after joining with the Alaknanda at
          Devprayag.
        </p>

        <h2>Gaumukh Glacier</h2>
        <p>
          While Gangotri is considered the spiritual source of the Ganges, the physical source lies 19 km further uphill
          at Gaumukh (meaning "cow's mouth"), a glacier at the foot of Bhagirathi peaks. Trekking to Gaumukh is a
          popular pilgrimage activity for the more adventurous, offering stunning views of the Himalayan landscape and
          the actual glacial source of the river.
        </p>

        <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
        <p>
          According to Hindu mythology, this is where Lord Shiva received the Ganges in his matted locks to break her
          fall when she descended from heaven. The area is charged with spiritual energy, and pilgrims believe that
          bathing in the icy waters here cleanses all sins. The evening Ganga Aarti (prayer ceremony) at the temple is a
          mesmerizing spiritual experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Surya Kund</h2>
        <p>
          Near the temple is Surya Kund, a natural thermal spring where pilgrims take a dip before entering the temple.
          The warm waters provide relief from the typically cold climate of the region and are believed to have
          medicinal properties.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gangotri is accessible by road from May to October, after which it closes for winter due to heavy snowfall.
          During this closure, the deity is ceremoniously moved to Mukhba village, where worship continues through the
          winter months.

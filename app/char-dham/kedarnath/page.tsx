          Kedarnath, located at an altitude of 3,583 meters (11,755 feet) in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, is
          one of the most remote and breathtaking pilgrimage sites in the Char Dham circuit. Home to one of the 12
          Jyotirlingas (holy shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva), Kedarnath offers a powerful spiritual experience amidst
          the awe-inspiring Himalayan backdrop.

        <h2>The Ancient Temple</h2>
        <p>
          The Kedarnath Temple, believed to be over 1,200 years old, was built by Adi Shankaracharya. Constructed of
          large, evenly cut stone slabs, this remarkable structure has withstood the harsh mountain environment for
          centuries. Inside the temple stands a conical rock formation worshipped as Lord Shiva in his "Sadashiva" form.
          The temple miraculously survived the devastating Uttarakhand floods of 2013, which caused extensive damage to
          the surrounding area.
        </p>

        <h2>The Pilgrimage Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Reaching Kedarnath requires a challenging 16 km trek from Gaurikund, as no motorable roads lead to the temple.
          The arduous journey through stunning mountain landscapes is considered part of the spiritual experience. For
          those unable to walk, pony and palanquin services are available, or pilgrims can opt for helicopter services
          that operate during the pilgrimage season.
        </p>

        <h2>Bhairav Temple</h2>
        <p>
          A short climb above the Kedarnath Temple leads to the Bhairav Temple, dedicated to Lord Bhairav, believed to
          be a fierce manifestation of Lord Shiva who protects the area during winter when the main temple is closed.
          The viewpoint offers spectacular panoramic views of the Kedarnath Temple and the surrounding Himalayan peaks.
        </p>

        <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
        <p>
          According to Hindu mythology, the Pandavas sought Lord Shiva here to atone for their sins after the
          Kurukshetra War. When Shiva wished to avoid them, he took the form of a bull and hid among the mountains. When
          discovered, he dove into the ground, leaving parts of his body in five different locations - these became the
          five Kedars, with Kedarnath being the most important, representing Shiva's hump.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kedarnath is accessible only for about six months a year (late April to November), after which the temple
          closes due to heavy snowfall. During winter, the deity is moved to Ukhimath, where worship continues until the
          temple reopens in spring.

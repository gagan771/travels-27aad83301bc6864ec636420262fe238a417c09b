          Yamunotri, the westernmost shrine of the Char Dham pilgrimage, marks the source of the River Yamuna and is
          dedicated to Goddess Yamuna. Nestled in the Garhwal Himalayas at an altitude of 3,293 meters (10,804 feet),
          this sacred site offers a profound spiritual experience amidst breathtaking natural beauty.
        </p>

        <h2>The Sacred Temple</h2>
        <p>
          The Yamunotri Temple, originally built by Maharani Gularia of Jaipur in the 19th century, has been restored
          several times due to weather damage. The modest temple houses a small black marble idol of Goddess Yamuna.
          Adjacent to the temple are hot springs where pilgrims cook rice and potatoes to be offered as prasad (blessed
          food) at the temple.
        </p>

        <h2>The Pilgrimage Journey</h2>
        <p>
          The journey to Yamunotri begins from Janki Chatti or Hanuman Chatti, involving a 6-7 km trek along a
          picturesque mountain path. For those unable to walk, palanquins and ponies are available. The trail follows
          the Yamuna River, passing through stunning landscapes of dense forests, waterfalls, and mountain vistas.
        </p>

        <h2>Thermal Springs</h2>
        <p>
          Near the temple, the Surya Kund hot spring is of special significance. With water temperatures reaching near
          boiling point, pilgrims cook rice and potatoes in cloth bags tied to ropes and dipped into the spring. Taking
          a dip in the nearby Yamuna Kund, where hot and cold water mix, is believed to purify the soul.
        </p>

        <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
        <p>
          According to Hindu mythology, Yamuna is the daughter of Surya (the Sun God) and sister of Yama (the God of
          Death). It is believed that bathing in the sacred waters of Yamuna absolves one from painful death. The
          pilgrimage to Yamunotri is typically the first stop in the Char Dham circuit, symbolizing the beginning of the
          soul's journey toward salvation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The best time to visit Yamunotri is between May to June and September to October, as the temple remains closed
          during winter months due to heavy snowfall in the region.
